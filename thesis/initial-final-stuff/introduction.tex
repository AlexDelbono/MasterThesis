These years are characterized by the development of the robotics.
The increasing number of applications of mobile robots and drones in many fields
has brought important progresses in the autonomy of the vehicles.
The power consumptions of the machines are significantly reduced and we are now
able to build smaller and lighter vehicles. In particular, in the aerial field,
there are commercial products which weight about 200g with a flight time of 20
minutes. These improvements allow us to develop more advanced features, such as
trajectory planning, obstacles avoidance, formation flight.
