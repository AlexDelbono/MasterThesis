In this chapter, we will describe the hardware and software architecture of the system.
Most of the software is completely decoupled from the hardware part and can be run
on different machines, allowing portability and reusability. On the contrary, the
code is developed only for the specific hardware; mostly the code which is more related
to the specific functionalities of the hardware itself. We will have an overview of the hardware
used and then we will show a general software architecture and its deployment on the
machines involved.
