In this chapter, we will examine the structure of the consensus node. We will see
its main components and we will show some snippets of code
in order to make clearer which parts are involved.

As shown in the general architecture (chapter \ref{chap:system_architecture}),
the consensus node is developed as a ROS node, which subscribes and publishes messages
to different topics.
Moreover, the node offers some ROS services used to start and to stop the trajectory
following algorithm or the consensus algorithm.

The structure of the node takes into account the main architectural patterns used
in the software development field and it was designed to allow the maximum degree
of usability and customization. However, since it has to be executed on
machines with limited amount of resources, one of the most important metric taken
into account is the efficiency of the code.

The node functionalities are enclosed into a C++ class which initializes
all the ROS elements and prepares the node to receive the start and stop commands.
The initialization is done by the class constructor when the object is created.
First, in order to apply the consensus dynamic equation, we need
the current position of the UAV. The Px4 board already publishes the estimated
local position on a topic.
Therefore, all we need to do is subscribe to that topic to retrieve the messages
with the required information.
Second, we want to publish the consensus variable of the drone in the topic used
by all the other UAVs, because, having obtained the others' consensus variables
from the same topic, we are able to compute the proportional consensus error.
Third, since we want to compute the position error and weight
it for the target velocity, we need the next set point and the next desired velocity profile.
Finally, we compute the acceleration of the consensus parameter using the consensus equation (\ref{eq:cons_law})
and we publish the next set point. We will see the details through the code.
All these elements can be summarized and shown in Figure \ref{fig:node_in_out}.

The subscription of a ROS topic works through a callback function, which accepts as
parameter the pointer to the new message. Since in our case we have multiple subscriptions
and we must advertise the start and stop services, we need to implement a multithreading
architecture which takes care of the concurrent accesses to the state of our object.
Three threads have been used and their functions are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start and stop services
  \item Consensus variable callback
  \item Local position callback
\end{itemize}
