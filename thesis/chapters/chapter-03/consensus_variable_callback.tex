\section{Consensus variable callback\label{sec:consensus_variable_callback}}

The thread responsible for collecting the consensus variables of all the other UAVs,
is managed by ROS and it executes a callback function when a new message is published
on a specific topic.
This topic is used by all the drones to publish their consensus variable, $\gamma_i$,
and it accepts a custom message which contains only a string with the name of the
owner of the variable and the value itself. The message has also a header, which contains
general information such as timestamp or message ID.
The structure of the message can be seen in the Figure \ref{fig:custom_message}.

The callback function receives the information from the topic and updates a local
view of the variables of the neighbors. This information has a timeout validity,
because we do not want to consider values which are too old. Indeed, if we considered too old
values and a problem in the network caused a loss of packets, our drone might
think that the other drones have significantly different values of the consensus variables
and might therefore wait for them. This is why, it is better to discard these values and
remove the neighbors after a timeout.

In order to store this information, we use a thread safe support class, which
provides a procedure to check if the variable is expired or not.
The signatures of the methods of the class are presented in the Figure
\ref{fig:consensuss_variable_class}.
We use a container to store the values of the neighbors and we always check if the
value has expired or not before using it.

These variables are used in the consensus law (\ref{eq:cons_law})
as $\gamma_j$ of the neighbors and are used to compute the proportional error.
We can see that the expiration interval of the values can model the
fact that the network topology can change.
Indeed, if a link between two drones vanished because, for instance, they were
too far from each other, after a timeout (which it is equal to the expiration time),
the neighbor would be removed from the container and the drone would not take into
account the old neighbor.
The timeout can even ignore a failure of a drone: if a machine had a critical
problem and did not send its consensus variable, the other drones would remove it from
their neighbors and continue their mission without problems.
