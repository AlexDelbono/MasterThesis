\section{Convergence property\label{sec:convergence_property}}

The control law given by \eqref{eq:cons_law} guarantees that the error of the
“Consensus” algorithm converges to zero exponentially.
It can be shown that the maximum convergence rate is given by the sum of
the convergence rate of the path following error and the term

\begin{equation}
  \frac{a}{b} \frac{N \mu}{T ( 1 + (a / b) N T)^2}
\end{equation}

which depends on the control gains $a$ and $b$, the number of vehicles $N$ and
the quality of service of the communication network, characterized by the parameters
$T$ and $\mu$.
If we fix the gains and the number of the vehicles, the convergence rate depends
only on the amount of information which the agents exchange each other over time.
